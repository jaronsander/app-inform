They help companies grow by building and optimizing their growth stack, and by providing them with a growth team. They provide value by alleviating the following pain points:
Pain 1: just reporting metrics, lack of insights coming from reports. Just “good” or “bad”, lack of clarity as to “why”
Value 1: insightful reporting on relationships between different parts of the funnel. Seek clarity on “slices” of funnel
Pain 2: volatile sales, no seeming predictability or pattern to lead gen and sales.
Value 2: Building resilience through implementing experimentation frameworks that generate insight and allow you to see what is working and what is now
Pain 3: Sales funnel is inefficient, tire kickers wasting sales reps time, lots of follow up required by sales rep, lots of back and forth required. Sales teams time is not being used effectively
Value 3: Leveraging modern technology to optimize processes like large language models and statistical models. Ai pre qualification, follow up clarity, sales rep action recommendations.
